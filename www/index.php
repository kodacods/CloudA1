<h1>Webserver test page.</h1>

<p>This page demonstrates that the webserver on your VM is generating content.</p>

<p>You likely now want to <a href="test-database.php">proceed to your webserver's
database connection testing page</a>. However, note that if there is a network problem reaching the database, the database connection testing page will spend a minute or so waiting before it produces any content.</p>

<p>For your assignment work, your project should begin on this page. The only reason the database testing page was not placed within <kbd>index.php</kbd> was to assist you in debugging any network problems you might be having.</p>
